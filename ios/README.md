## How to install the module:

```

2. Copy the zip file to the root of your project.
3. require the module in your application:

```
var Draggable = require('ti.draggable');
```

4. Clean your build directory
5. Build.

## How to use the module
To create a draggable view, simple create it like so:
```
   var view = Draggable.createView({ _props });
```

To create an infinite scroll view, create it like this:
```
   var scroll = Draggable.createInfiniteScroll({ _props });
```

Treat both of these views as a normal Ti.UI.Views.
For the draggable view, keep in mind that it has the draggable properties already build in; if nothing is specified, it will be draggable all over the screen.

## Draggable View Properties:

### These will make the view stop at their corresponding positions

* maxLeft: (int)
* minLeft: (int)
* maxTop: (int)
* minTop: (int)

### This will make the view stick to it's axis:

* axis: (String) "x" or "y"

### canRotate ( bool ) { default: false }

* Wether the view can rotate with two fingers

### canResize ( bool ) { default: false }

* Wether the view can resize with two fingers

### isDraggable ( bool ) { default: true }

* Wether the view can will be draggable

## Event Listeners

1. start: will fire on touch start
2. end: will fire on when the view has finished moving


## Infinite Scroll View Properties:

### One property at the moment:

* views: (array of views)

## Event Listeners

1. click: will fire on click. It contains an index number of the view clicked as well as a reference to the it.
